## Here is a project I made with the help of youtube. <br >
![](face_eye_detector.gif) <br >
*Try it out if you want and let me know what you think* <br >
Step 1: install thonny go here: https://thonny.org/ or sudo apt install thonny <br >
Step 2: Go to Tool > Manage packages > Type: opencv-python > then install <br >
Step 3: run camera.py with green play button or F5 <br ><br >

This is just an example and I would like some ideas on how to make it better. If we choose this project I would like to improve it.<br >
